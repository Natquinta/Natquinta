- ðŸ’¬ About me:
  I am an experienced professional in the culinary world who has decided to shift toward data analysis. With a strong interest in technology and an analytical mind, I have acquired new skills in tools such as Python, SQL, and Tableau, seeking to apply this knowledge to generate insights and make informed decisions.

  Although my experience in data is recent, my focus is on learning quickly and applying my analytical skills practically. My passion for cooking and wine has taught me the importance of detail, precision, and creativity, skills I am bringing to my new career in data.

  I am excited about the opportunities to collaborate and grow on projects that allow me to continue developing my knowledge in this field.
